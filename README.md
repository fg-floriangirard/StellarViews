# StellarViews - Explore the Universe! 🚀

Welcome to StellarViews, an interactive project that allows users to embark on a journey through the universe! Developed as a personal project, StellarViews served as my launchpad into the world of JavaScript. As an aspiring programmer, I saw this project as the perfect opportunity to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while combining my fascination with the cosmos. :computer:
